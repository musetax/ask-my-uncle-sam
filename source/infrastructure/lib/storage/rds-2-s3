i need take our rds database and make an exact replica of it in an s3 bucket that has spark so it can be accessed by our Gen AI application.

i want you to write the scripts and tell me how i can run them from my computer.

the RDS database is called muserdsdatabasestackdev-musepostegresdb7c7399eb-bpea3lf2piue and it's endpoint is muserdsdatabasestackdev-musepostegresdb7c7399eb-bpea3lf2piue.cx6jkfcjvffe.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com.

my vpc security group is MuseRdsDatabaseStackDEV-MusePostegresDBSecurityGroup6DEB9B6E-Bq9jjRfSpqvL (sg-06b827257888dd324)

and the vpc is Availability Zone
us-east-1a
VPC
muse-vpc-dev (vpc-0e98b1b9896aa031f)
Subnet group
muserdsdatabasestackdev-musepostegresdbsubnetgroup9cd06f0c-n1gfjme6t2rn
Subnets
subnet-035dc8da994fa2827
subnet-05899495872fdee55

the s3 bucket is a general purpose bucket named
checkboostinfo. the access point is named checkboostinfos3accesspoint and the alias is checkboostinfos3acce-fg9nikokxdkfojs7sdy6iaaj7978wuse1b-s3alias

please let me know any other information you need to write the scripts and where i can get it from.

i can't use dms because of my vpc

------------------------------

give me step by step instructions and how to create an RDS connection in the AWS Glue console or using the AWS CLI before running this script.

also, i want you to rewrite this code so i can copy and paste it knowing that the db username is museplatformdb, and also tell me where i can find the other information i need to complete this script is
