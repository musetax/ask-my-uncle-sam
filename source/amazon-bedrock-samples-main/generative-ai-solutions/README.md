# Generative AI use-cases

This repo explores various generative AI use-cases and integrations with Amazon Bedrock.

## Contents

- [Connecting API Gateway & Lambda to Bedrock](bedrock-api-gateway) - Sample pattern connecting Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda with Bedrock

- [Java Connection](java-connection) - Sample code for creating a connection to Amazon Bedrock through the AWS Java SDK

- [AWS Genai LLM Chatbot](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot) - A modular and comprehensive solution to deploy a multi LLM powered chatbot (Amazon Bedrock)

- [`VTT file processing and model evaluations with Amazon Bedrock`](./bedrock-vtt-file-processing-and-model-evals/) - Implement a simple [`Video Text to track (VTT)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT) file processing solution that chaptertizes VTT files (transcripts) and uses Amazon Bedrock to create titles for each of the chapters using different Foundation Models (FMs) available via Amazon Bedrock. We also show use of [`LiteLLM`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) as an easy to use interface for Bedrock.
