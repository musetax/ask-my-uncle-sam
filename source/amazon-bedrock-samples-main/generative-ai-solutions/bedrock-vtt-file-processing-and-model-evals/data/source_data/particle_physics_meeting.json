The data on the Higgs boson is quite fascinating.\n\n2 \"Dr. M\" (2345678901)\n00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.720\nYes, I've been studying the particle trajectories closely. The decay patterns are consistent with our theoretical models.\n\n3 \"Dr. S\" (3456789012)\n00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.500\nI'm more interested in the potential applications of these findings. Could we harness the Higgs field for energy production?\n\n4 \"Dr. D\" (4567890123)\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.870\nThat's an intriguing idea, but we'd need to overcome some significant technical hurdles first.\n\n5 \"Dr. E\" (1234567890)\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.140\nAbsolutely. Have you considered the implications of these findings on our understanding of dark matter?",
